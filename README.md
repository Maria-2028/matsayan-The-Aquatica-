## *An AI-powered solution to protect marine ecosystems*  

The Floating Aquatic Monitoring System* is an autonomous, solar-powered device that monitors marine environments in real-time. It detects pollution, tracks marine life, and collects critical water quality data to help combat ocean pollution and protect aquatic biodiversity.  

---  

##  The Problem: Why This Matters*  
Our oceans face unprecedented threats:  
- *8 million tons* of plastic enter the oceans yearly  
- *Marine life* is endangered by pollution and habitat degradation  
- *Manual monitoring* is slow, expensive, and lacks real-time insights  

This system provides an *automated, sustainable solution* to:  
 Detect & classify floating waste  
 Monitor marine life behaviour  
 Track water quality (pH, temperature, turbidity, salinity)  
 Operate 24/7 using solar energy
